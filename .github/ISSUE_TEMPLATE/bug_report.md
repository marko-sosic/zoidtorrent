- [ ] I have read the **issue reporting section** in the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/zoidtorrent/zoidtorrent/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), so I know how to submit a good bug report with the required information
- [ ] I have verified that the **issue is not fixed and is reproducible** in the **[latest version](https://www.zoidtorrent.org/download.php)**
- [ ] (optional but recommended) I have verified that the **issue is not fixed and is reproducible** in the **[latest CI build](https://github.com/zoidtorrent/zoidtorrent/actions/workflows/ci.yaml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush)**

The [wiki](https://github.com/zoidtorrent/zoidtorrent/wiki) did not contain a suitable solution either
